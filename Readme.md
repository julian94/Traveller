# Traveller Ship Combat

This is a tool to simulate/automate ship combats in Traveller.

## ~~Plans~~ *Hopes & Dreams*
1. Finish core system so that it can handle most aspects of combat other than decision-making.
2. Make very simple terminal client for running combat.
3. Make very simple website for running combat.
4. Make discord bot for running combat.
5. ~~Ask for permission to do this project from the rights holder (Mongoose Publishing).~~ Acquired. 
6. Have thorough enough unit tests that the users can't find bugs.
7. Find a good way to handle enemies that aren't in a straight line.
